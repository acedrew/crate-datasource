### What Is Crate?
Crate is an open source fast, scalable, easy to use SQL database that plays nicely with containers like Docker. It feels like the SQL databases you know, but makes scaling and operating your database ridiculously easy - regardless of the volume, complexity, or type of data. It ingests millions of records per second for time series setups and delivers analytics results in sub-second real time.

Crate comes with a distributed sort and aggregation engine, fast multi index queries, native full-text search and super simple scalability with sharding and partitioning builtin. Preconfigured replication takes care of data resiliency. The cluster management can be supervised with a built-in admin UI. Crate's masterless architecture and simplicity make the data part of Docker environments easy and elegant.

Crate provides several installation packages, including a supported Docker image. It fits perfectly into an orchestrated microservices environment. It acts like an ephemeral, omnipresent, persistent layer for data. Application containers access their data regardless of which host the data nodes run.
