[![Crate.io logo](crate-logo.png)](https://crate.io)

## What Is Crate?
Crate is an open source fast, scalable, easy to use SQL database that plays nicely with containers like Docker. It feels like the SQL databases you know, but makes scaling and operating your database ridiculously easy - regardless of the volume, complexity, or type of data. It ingests millions of records per second for time series setups and delivers analytics results in sub-second real time.
